# dispensing-process monitor
Shiny app displaying KPIs and other relevant metrics of the dispensing process suitable for use in a hospital pharmacy. This app includes a simulator written with Simmer to help staff understand their dispensing process better by exploring the effect of staff availability and arrival patterns of presriptions on the efficiency of the process.

The uploaded files serve to demonstrate the capabilities of the app. Data included were created by scrambling original data so no conclusions can be drawn about the process of the hospital where this app was first deployed. In this process, the original app was slightly changed. 

This app was deployed to https://finalprojectje.shinyapps.io/upload_to_shinyapps/ to allow viewing of its features.
